Here’s the same AWS Admin day‑to‑day activities write‑up with the name changed to **Kartikeya**.

## ✅ Daily Activities (AWS Admin) — “My name is Kartikeya…”
My name is **Kartikeya**, and my day‑to‑day activities as an **AWS Administrator** mainly include **checking tickets, monitoring AWS resources, managing access, and supporting deployments and incidents**. Here’s what I typically do each day:

---

## 🎫 1) Ticket Handling & User Support
I start my day by **checking new and pending tickets** in the queue and prioritizing them based on severity (P1/P2/P3).

- Work on requests like **EC2 access**, **S3 access**, **IAM permissions**, **security group changes**, and **VPN connectivity**
- Coordinate with application/dev teams to clarify requirements
- Update ticket notes, keep timelines clear, and close with proper validation

---

## 📊 2) Monitoring & Health Checks
I monitor the environment to ensure services are stable and performance is normal.

- Check **CloudWatch alarms**, dashboards, and service health
- Review **CPU/RAM/disk**, instance status checks, and load balancer health
- Investigate alerts and do first-level troubleshooting

---

## 🔐 3) IAM & Security (Access Control)
A big part of my daily work is making sure access is correct and secure.

- Create/manage **IAM users, roles, groups**, and permission policies (least privilege)
- Review access issues and fix permission errors
- Rotate credentials where required and enforce **MFA**
- Check for risky configurations (open security groups, public buckets, etc.)

---

## 🖥️ 4) EC2 / Compute Administration
I handle operational tasks around compute resources.

- Start/stop/reboot instances based on maintenance or schedule
- Create/attach **EBS volumes**, snapshots, and troubleshoot disk space issues
- Manage **AMIs** and assist in instance provisioning
- Validate patching / OS level checks (as per process)

---

## 🗄️ 5) Storage & Backup Tasks (S3 / EBS)
I manage storage requests and data-related tasks.

- Support **S3 bucket creation**, access policies, lifecycle rules, and encryption
- Restore data using **snapshots/backups** if needed
- Troubleshoot storage permission errors and access failures

---

## 🌐 6) Networking Support (VPC Basics)
I assist with AWS networking changes and troubleshooting.

- Handle requests for **VPC**, subnets, route tables, NACLs, and security groups
- Troubleshoot **DNS, connectivity, VPN, and routing** issues
- Support **Load Balancers** and basic traffic flow checks

---

## 🚀 7) Deployments & Change Management
I support planned changes and deployments.

- Participate in change windows and follow approval processes
- Validate services after deployment (health checks, logs, alarms)
- Rollback support if needed

---

## 🧾 8) Documentation & Reporting
I keep things documented so support is smooth and auditable.

- Update SOPs/runbooks, access documentation, and environment details
- Share daily/weekly status reports: tickets resolved, incidents, pending actions
